<!-- Yes, you can run SQL queries in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) using various extensions. One popular extension for working with SQL in VSCode is called "SQL Server (mssql)".

Here's how you can set it up and use it:

1. **Install the Extension:**
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window.
   - Search for "SQL Server (mssql)" and install the extension.

2. **Connect to a Database:**
   - After installing the extension, you can see a "SQL Server" icon on the left sidebar.
   - Click on the icon, and then click on the "New Connection" button.
   - Enter the necessary connection details like server name, authentication type, username, password, and database name.
   - Once connected, you will see your connection listed under "Connections".

3. **Write and Execute SQL Queries:**
   - Right-click on the connected database and select "New Query".
   - This will open a new tab where you can write your SQL query.
   - To execute the query, you can either press the "F5" key or right-click and select "Run Query".

Here's an example SQL query that you can try running:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees;
```

Remember to modify the query according to your database structure.

This extension also provides features like IntelliSense for SQL, query execution history, and more. Keep in mind that this extension is primarily intended for working with Microsoft SQL Server, but you can also use it for other databases with slight adjustments.

Additionally, there are other SQL-related extensions available in the VSCode marketplace that you can explore if you're working with different databases or prefer different features. -->
