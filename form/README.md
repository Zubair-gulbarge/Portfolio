Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. `const express = require('express');` - Import the Express.js framework.
2. `const fs = require('fs');` - Import the Node.js File System module for file operations.
3. `const app = express();` - Create an Express application instance.
4. `const path = require('path');` - Import the Node.js Path module for handling file paths.

5. `app.use(express.static('public'));` - Serve static files (HTML, CSS, JS) from the `public` directory.
6. `app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));` - Middleware to parse URL-encoded request bodies.
7. `app.use(express.json());` - Middleware to parse JSON request bodies.

8. `app.get('/', ...)` - Respond with the HTML file when a GET request is made to the root path ('/').
9. `app.post('/submit-form', ...)` - Handle form submission when a POST request is made to '/submit-form'.

10. Inside the `/submit-form` route handler, the submitted form data is logged to the console.
11. The form submission data is appended to the `submissions.txt` file using `fs.appendFile`.
12. If an error occurs while saving the data, an error response (HTTP 500) is sent.
13. If the data is saved successfully, a success response (HTTP 200) is sent.

14. `const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;` - Set the port for the server.
15. `app.listen(port, ...)` - Start the server and listen on the specified port.

Overall, the code structure is appropriate for handling form submissions in an Express.js application. However, to ensure everything works as expected, make sure the following:

1. You have a `public` directory containing the `index.html` file.
2. The form's `action` attribute matches the route (`'/submit-form'`) in your Express route handler.
3. Your HTML form elements have the correct `name` attributes to match the keys in the `formSubmission` object.

Once you have this code in place, running the server and submitting the form should log the form data to the console and save it to the `submissions.txt` file.
